# Verity Forecaster: The Institutional Demo Playbook

This document is a professional, high-impact guide designed for an executive-level walkthrough. It transitions from fund-level modeling to long-term wealth projections and final resilience testing.

## 🖥️ Screen 1: Assumptions Studio (The "Home" Page)
**Theme:** *Engineering the Fund DNA*

### 🛠️ Key Functionalities (The "How it Works")
1.  **High-Fidelity J-Curve Controls**: 
    *   **Pacing & Depth**: Models the initial "Valley of Death." Adjusting depth simulates how aggressive or conservative the early investment period is.
    *   **Breakeven & Dist. Velocity**: Directly controls the pivot point where the fund crosses into profitability.
2.  **Bidirectional Multiples Engine**: 
    *   **Proportional Sync**: Changing TVPI (Total Value) automatically recalculates DPI (Realized) and RVPI (Unrealized) targets.
3.  **Strategy-Specific Benchmarking**: 
    *   Visual comparison against "BlackRock Vesey Street" or "Columbia Partners" templates to show where your manager sits relative to the market.
4.  **Dynamic KPI Dashboard**: 
    *   9 real-time metrics (ITD IRR, Peak NAV, RVPI, etc.) update instantly as you move sliders, proving the real-time power of the engine.

### 🔬 The Anatomy of J-Curve Controls (Technical Deep Dive)
*When the client asks "What exactly does this dropdown change?", use these definitions:*

1.  **Deployment Pacing**: Controls the velocity of capital calls.
    *   *Significance*: Front-loading (e.g., Secondaries) reduces unfunded drag but increases early cash needs. Back-loading (e.g., VC) allows capital to grow elsewhere until needed.
2.  **J-Curve Depth**: Models the magnitude of the initial negative returns (fees + early markdowns).
    *   *Significance*: Infrastructure typically has "Shallow" curves due to early yield. Early Stage VC has "Deep" curves due to high initial burn and long product cycles.
3.  **Time to Breakeven**: The precise point where cumulative net cash flow turns positive.
    *   *Significance*: A key liquidity metric. Strategies with early breakeven (Secondary, Private Credit) provide faster recycling potential.
4.  **Distribution Start & Speed**: Defines the inception and slope of the realization phase.
    *   *Significance*: High speed models "quick flip" or aggressive realization markets. Slow speed models challenging exit environments (e.g., current M&A frost).

## 🖥️ Screen 2: Cash Flow Forecasting (Portfolio Growth)
**Theme:** *Navigating Institutional Wealth Horizons*

### 🛠️ Key Functionalities
1.  **25-Year Strategic Wealth Engine**: 
    *   Captures the full power of private market compounding beyond standard 5-year windows.
2.  **Probabilistic Monte Carlo Paths**: 
    *   Displays three distinct futures: **Conservative** (Lower risk/return), **Moderate** (Base case), and **Aggressive** (Alpha-focused).
3.  **The "Alpha" Deep-Dive (Sparkles Modal)**:
    *   **Dynamic Asset Allocation**: Click the icon to see the mix required to hit the target.
    *   **Strategic Weights**: Each profile has a unique target. Aggressive models 15%+ in PE; Conservative shifts to 50% Fixed Income.
4.  **Likelihood Attribution**: 
    *   Instantly see the statistical confidence for each wealth tier (e.g., "33% Likelihood for Aggressive").

## 🖥️ Screen 3: Scenario Simulation
**Theme:** *Stress Testing Reality & Resilience*

### 🛠️ Key Functionalities
1.  **One-Click Macro Shock Testing**: 
    *   Apply historical-grade shocks like **Recession**, **Stagflation**, or **Liquidity Crunch**.
2.  **Financial Signage Convention Chart**: 
    *   **Negative Bars**: Capital calls (cash leaving your pocket) are shown below the line.
    *   **Positive Bars**: Distributions (cash returned) are shown above.
3.  **AI-Driven Narrative Insights**: 
    *   Generates a specific "Story of the Scenario," highlighting short-term pain vs. long-term recovery.
4.  **Strategic Action Planner**: 
    *   Context-aware recommendations (e.g., "Upsize Credit Facility") based on detected liquidity gaps.

## ✨ The "Wow" Factor Checklist:
- [ ] **Interactive Shift**: Move a slider in Assumptions Studio and point out the ITD IRR updating in real-time.
- [ ] **The "Alpha" Reveal**: Click the Sparkles icon on the Aggressive row in Portfolio Growth to show the target asset allocation mix.
- [ ] **Scenario Switch**: Change to "Recession" and watch the bars flip below the zero-line as calls accelerate.
- [ ] **Signage Explanation**: "We show contributions as negative values because that's the true heartbeat of your liquidity—actual cash leaving the treasury."
