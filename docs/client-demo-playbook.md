This document provides a scripted walkthrough and functional guide for the Verity Forecaster application. Use this to guide your client presentation for maximum impact.

## 🎯 The Core Narrative
**"From Visibility to Certainty"**
*The private market landscape is often opaque. Verity Forecaster turns raw fund data into institutional-grade foresight, allowing you to model fund DNA, project 25-year wealth, and stress-test your portfolio against global volatility.*

---

## 🖥️ Screen 1: Assumptions Studio
**Theme:** *Modeling the Fund DNA*

### 🛠️ Key Functionalities
1.  **J-Curve Shape Controls**: 
    - **Pacing & Depth**: Adjust how fast capital is called and how deep the "valley of death" (negative returns) goes.
    - **Breakeven Timing**: Models exactly when the cumulative cash flow is expected to cross into profit.
2.  **Multiples Target Engine**: 
    - **TVPI/DPI/RVPI Sync**: Changing the J-Curve shape (like speed of distribution) automatically updates the target realized (DPI) and unrealized (RVPI) multiples.
3.  **Summary Outputs**:
    - **Dynamic KPIs**: Real-time updates for Total Called, Ending NAV, and ITD IRR as you move sliders.
4.  **Assumption Sets (Comparison)**:
    - **Side-by-Side Analysis**: Select multiple saved sets to compare different manager strategies (e.g., Buyout vs. Venture) in a professional drawer.

### 🎭 Storytelling Script
> "Before we forecast a portfolio, we must understand the funds within it. In the **Assumptions Studio**, we don't just pick a return; we model the life-cycle. 
> 
> Watch as I adjust the **J-Curve Depth**. Notice how the performance profile dips—this isn't just a graphic; it's recalculating the ITD IRR and the funding pressure. We are creating a 'digital twin' of your investment strategy."

## 🖥️ Screen 2: Cash Flow Forecasting (Portfolio Growth)
**Theme:** *Institutional Wealth Horizons*

### 🛠️ Key Functionalities
1.  **25-Year Long-Term Projection**:
    - Extends far beyond standard 5-year views to capture the full compounding power of private equity.
2.  **Monte Carlo Risk Profiles**:
    - **Conservative, Moderate, Aggressive**: Three distinct paths modeled with varying mean returns and standard deviations.
3.  **The "Alpha" Deep-Dive (High-Contrast Modals)**:
    - **Dynamic Asset Allocation**: Click the **Sparkles** icon.
    - **Scenario Specificity**: Each outlook has unique weights. Conservative is heavy on Fixed Income; Aggressive is optimized with 15%+ in Private Equity.
    - **High-Contrast Design**: Labels and headers are pure black for maximum readability during screen-sharing.
4.  **Dynamic Likelihood Scores**:
    - Surfaced % Likelihood metrics for each path to provide immediate risk context.

### 🎭 Storytelling Script
> "Now, we translate fund performance into total wealth. We’ve set the investment horizon to **25 years** because private markets are a marathon, not a sprint.
> 
> Here’s the **Wow Factor**: If I open the **Aggressive Outlook** details, you’ll see our target asset allocation has shifted. The system isn't just increasing the return rate; it's showing you the *portfolio composition* required to reach that $100M+ terminal value. It’s strategy, not just math."

## 🖥️ Screen 3: Scenario Simulation
**Theme:** *Stress Testing Reality*

### 🛠️ Key Functionalities
1.  **Macro Scenario Selector**:
    - **Recession, Rising Rates, Liquidity Crunch**: Instantly re-models the entire portfolio based on historical macro-shocks.
2.  **Visual Cash Flow (Signage Convention)**:
    - **Negative Contributions**: Capital calls are clearly shown below the zero-line.
    - **Positive Withdrawals**: Distributions are shown above.
3.  **Axis Integrity**:
    - Optimized margins ensuring the 'Portfolio & Liquidity' labels are never cut off.
4.  **Actionable Recommendations**:
    - Context-aware insights that tell the client exactly what to do (e.g., "Upsize Credit Facility") when a liquidity gap is detected.

### 🎭 Storytelling Script
> "Finally, we ask: 'What if the world breaks?' Let's apply a **Recession** scenario. 
> 
> Look at the **Visualization Chart**. Notice the bars below the line—our **Contributions** are accelerating as GPs call capital to save assets, while our **Withdrawals (the positive bars)** are drying up. 
> 
> This isn't just a chart; it's your early warning system. It identifies the exact quarter you’ll hit a liquidity gap so you can act today."

## ✨ The "Wow" Factor Checklist for the Demo:
- [ ] **Interactive Sliders**: Always move a slider in Assumptions Studio to show the J-Curve and Summary metrics update in real-time.
- [ ] **The Modal Reveal**: Open a "Portfolio Growth" modal and point out the **Total Row** at the bottom—it proves the model's integrity.
- [ ] **Scenario Switch**: Move from "Base Case" to "Liquidity Crunch" and wait 1 second for the charts to re-animate. The visual shift is powerful.
- [ ] **Color Contrast**: Mention that the high-contrast black-on-white text in pop-ups was specifically chosen for executive-level clarity.
