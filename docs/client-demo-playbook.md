# Verity Forecaster: The Institutional Demo Playbook

This document is a professional, high-impact guide designed for an executive-level walkthrough. It transitions from fund-level modeling to long-term wealth projections and final resilience testing.

## 🖥️ Screen 1: Assumptions Studio
**Theme:** *Engineering the Fund DNA*

### 🛠️ Key Functionalities (The "How it Works")
1.  **High-Fidelity J-Curve Controls**: 
    *   **Pacing & Depth**: Models the initial "Valley of Death." Adjusting depth simulates how aggressive or conservative the early investment period is.
    *   **Breakeven & Dist. Velocity**: Directly controls the pivot point where the fund crosses into profitability, adjusting the slope of the realization curve.
2.  **Bidirectional Multiples Engine**: 
    *   **Proportional Sync**: Changing TVPI (Total Value) automatically recalculates DPI (Realized) and RVPI (Unrealized) based on the current J-Curve shape.
    *   **Heuristic MOIC Tracking**: Automatically scales Gross Multiples (MOIC) to ensure fee and carry assumptions remain institutionally sound.
3.  **Strategy-Specific Benchmarking**: 
    *   Visual comparison against "BlackRock Vesey Street" or "Columbia Partners" templates to show where your manager sits relative to the market.
4.  **Assumption Snapshot Manager**: 
    *   Save and name specific "Stress" or "Base" cases. Use the **Analytical Comparison Drawer** for side-by-side data attribution of up to 3 models.
5.  **Dynamic KPI Dashboard**: 
    *   9 real-time metrics (ITD IRR, Peak NAV, RVPI, etc.) that update 60 times per second as you move sliders, proving the real-time power of the engine.

### 🎭 Storytelling Script
> "Most tools treat private market returns as a flat line. In the **Assumptions Studio**, we treat them as a lifecycle. 
> 
> Watch the **J-Curve Performance Profile** as I adjust the **Distribution Speed** to 'Fast.' Notice how the slope of our DPI realization sharpens immediately. We aren't just picking an outcome; we are creating a 'digital twin' of the fund's DNA. 
> 
> This allows your team to move from static spreadsheets to dynamic 'what-if' modeling in seconds. If a GP promises a 2.5x TVPI, we can model the exact deployment pacing required to hit it."

## 🖥️ Screen 2: Cash Flow Forecasting (Portfolio Growth)
**Theme:** *Navigating Institutional Wealth Horizons*

### 🛠️ Key Functionalities (The "How it Works")
1.  **25-Year Strategic Wealth Engine**: 
    *   Extends beyond the standard 5-year window to capture the full power of private market compounding and lifecycle rollover.
2.  **Probabilistic Monte Carlo Paths**: 
    *   Displays three distinct futures: **Conservative** (Lower volatility, lower return), **Moderate** (Base case), and **Aggressive** (Alpha-focused).
3.  **The "Alpha" Deep-Dive (High-Contrast Modals)**:
    *   **Dynamic Asset Allocation**: Click the **Sparkles** icon to reveal the target composition.
    *   **Strategic Weights**: Each profile has a unique target. The **Aggressive** profile is optimized with 15%+ in PE, while **Conservative** shifts to 50% Fixed Income.
    *   **Institutional Totals**: Automated bottom-row totals ensure the terminal wealth value matches the asset allocation sum exactly.
4.  **% Likelihood Attribution**: 
    *   Instantly see the statistical confidence for each wealth tier, moving the conversation from 'hope' to 'probability.'
5.  **Interactive Cash Flow Inputs**: 
    *   Model annual contributions and withdrawals with inflation-linked increases to simulate a growing family office or institutional corpus.

### 🎭 Storytelling Script
> "Now, we translate fund behavior into total wealth. Because private markets are a marathon, we look out over a **25-year horizon**.
> 
> Look at the **Aggressive Outlook**. You’ll see a significant wealth spike, but let’s look at *why*. By opening the **Model Assumptions**, we see the system has automatically rebalanced our target weights. To hit this $100M+ target, the model is shifting us to a 60% Equity and 15% Private Equity allocation. 
> 
> It’s not just showing you a higher return; it’s showing you the *asset mix* required to sustain it. This transforms the tool from a calculator into a strategic advisor."

## 🖥️ Screen 3: Scenario Simulation
**Theme:** *Stress Testing Reality & Resilience*

### 🛠️ Key Functionalities (The "How it Works")
1.  **One-Click Macro Shock Testing**: 
    *   Instantly apply historical-grade shocks like **Recession**, **Stagflation**, or **Liquidity Crunch** to the entire portfolio.
2.  **Financial Signage Convention Chart**: 
    *   **Negative Bars**: Capital calls (outflows) are clearly shown below the zero-line.
    *   **Positive Bars**: Distributions (inflows) are shown above.
3.  **Dual-Axis Visualization**: 
    *   Simultaneously tracks **Net Cash Flow** (bars) against **Portfolio NAV & Liquidity Balance** (lines), showing exactly when funding needs exceed available cash.
4.  **AI-Driven Narrative Insights**: 
    *   The system generates a specific "Story of the Scenario," highlighting short-term pain versus long-term recovery potential.
5.  **Strategic Action Planner**: 
    *   Context-aware recommendations (e.g., "Upsize Credit Facility," "Monitor Concentration") based on the severity of the liquidity gap.
6.  **Cross-Scenario Comparison Table**: 
    *   A high-contrast grid comparing Ending Value, IRR, and Peak Funding Needs across scenarios to identify the 'Best' and 'Worst' case outcomes.

### 🎭 Storytelling Script
> "Finally, we ask the toughest question: 'What if the world breaks?' Let's apply a **Liquidity Crunch**. 
> 
> Watch the **Visualization Chart**. In a crunch, our **Withdrawals (the positive bars)** effectively vanish as the exit market freezes. Meanwhile, our **Contributions (the negative bars)** accelerate as GPs call capital to shore up balance sheets. 
> 
> Look at the **Peak Liquidity Pressure** metric. It has spiked to 'High.' The system is alerting us to a specific quarter where our funding gap becomes critical. This is your early warning system. It tells you today what you need to do to avoid a default in three years."

## ✨ The "Wow" Factor Checklist for your Demo:
- [ ] **Interactive Shift**: Move a slider in Assumptions Studio and wait for the client to notice the ITD IRR update in real-time.
- [ ] **The "Alpha" Reveal**: Click the Sparkles icon on the Aggressive row in Portfolio Growth. Point out the high-contrast black-on-white text for "Executive Clarity."
- [ ] **Scenario Switch**: Change from "Base Case" to "Recession" and point at the chart as the bars flip and the narrative text regenerates.
- [ ] **Signage Point**: Explain why the contributions are negative—"It represents cash leaving your pocket, giving you a true heartbeat of your liquidity."
- [ ] **25-Year Vision**: Mention that "standard tools stop at 5 or 10 years, but we model the full compounding lifecycle of your wealth."
